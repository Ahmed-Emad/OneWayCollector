Simple JS game, with timer, controls and score.

Live game: http://ahmedatef07.com/owc/

With an object only moves in 2 directions (right, up) and try to get the best score from this path.
The best score is calculated by trying all paths (backtracking + DP).

The game needs a lot of work on the UI of course, but I was only concerned to make the game works. 
So if you have any comments or feedback please come back to me, or fork it, edit it, and show me :D

Thanks.
